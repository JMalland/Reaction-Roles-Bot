# Reaction-Roles-Bot
A Discord bot designed to implement roles in a server. Just a little something I played around with during my independent study.
Lots of unused code due to ideas never implemented...
# Setup
Set up the Config.json file using your discord bot token, and invite the bot to your server.
Once the bot is invited, it sends a message in a server thread telling you what to do.
Just give it a higher permission role, and click the button. Off you go!
