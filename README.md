# Reaction-Roles-Bot
A Discord bot designed to implement roles in a server. Just a little something I played around with during my independent study.

Lots of unused code due to ideas never implemented...

I'm sad to say this likely will not be updated.
# Setup
Set up the Config.json file using your discord bot token, and invite the bot to your server.

Once the bot is invited, it sends a message in a server thread telling you what to do.

Just give it a higher permission role, and click the button. Off you go!

# Role Creation
The only command available is `!Roles create`, which opens the role creation UI. 

You can change the values of certain roles within this, it's not specific to creating.
